            The console method debug() outputs a message to the web console at the "debug" log level. The message is only displayed to the user if the console is configured to display debug output. In most cases, the log level is configured within the console UI. The Debug Console enables you to view the output and error messages. You can optionally make command prompt available. In order to open the debug console right click and click on "Inspect" or just simply press "CTRL + SHIFT + I". Then on the top we have to click on the 2nd option that says "Console". Use "Console.log(Write the Value you want to print here);" in order to print something on the console.      </p>
